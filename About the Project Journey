Introduction

This report summarizes the development of a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze tweet engagement rates. The project aimed to create interactive and visually appealing insights by applying advanced filtering, time-based visualizations, and user-focused features.


Background

Social media analytics is critical for understanding audience behavior. This project specifically targeted tweet engagement metrics, focusing on likes, retweets, impressions, and contextual filters to gain actionable insights.


Learning Objectives

Master advanced Power BI functionalities, including DAX measures and dynamic filtering.

Enhance visualization skills to build user-friendly dashboards.

Apply logical conditions to reflect real-world scenarios dynamically.


Activities and Tasks

Task 1: Develop a table for the top 10% tweets with the highest engagement rates under specific conditions.

Task 2: Build a chart to identify the top 10 tweets by combined likes and retweets, with various filters.

Task 3: Compare engagement rates for tweets with and without app opens, applying dynamic visibility rules.

Preprocessing steps like character removal, word count calculations, and DAX-based conditions were implemented to refine data.


Skills and Competencies

Technical Skills: Proficiency in DAX for complex measures, Power BI visualization techniques, and dynamic filtering.

Problem-Solving: Designing logical workflows for time and data-based conditions.

Attention to Detail: Managing granular filtering criteria to meet specific requirements.


Feedback and Evidence

Feedback: I was personally satisfied with the dynamic visibility of graphs and the clean, organized design. The ability to adapt visualizations to real-time scenarios improved my confidence in creating professional dashboards.

Evidence: Final dashboard included time-sensitive visualizations and text-based summaries dynamically adapting to user conditions.


Challenges and Solutions

Issue: Engagement rate values initially appeared incorrect due to measure dependencies.

Solution: Refined DAX measures and added intermediate debugging steps.

Issue: Filters resulted in empty tables or graphs in some scenarios.

Solution: Adjusted threshold values and ensured logical compatibility of conditions.


Outcomes and Impact

Delivered a fully functional and visually engaging Power BI dashboard.

Enabled stakeholders to draw actionable insights from filtered data.

Gained hands-on experience with dynamic filtering, user-focused design, and advanced DAX logic.


Conclusion

The project successfully met its objectives, creating a robust and user-friendly dashboard. It enhanced analytical and visualization skills, addressed complex challenges, and delivered impactful solutions for social media data analysis.
