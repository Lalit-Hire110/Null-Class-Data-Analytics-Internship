# Null-Class-Data-Analytics-Internship
This Repository contains the projects I have done while being Intern at Null Class.  
Project 1: Analysis of Twitter(X) Dataset using Power BI.
I have been given 3 tasks to perform on this project.
which are, 
1. Develop a chart that displays tweets with the highest engagement rates (top 10%). Include only those tweets that have received more than 50 likes and were posted on weekdays and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself as well as tweet character count should be below 30.

2. Build a chart to identify the top 10 tweets by the sum of retweets and likes. Filter out tweets posted on weekends and show the user profile that posted each tweet and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet impression should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet word count be below 30

3. Analyse tweets to show a comparison of the engagement rate for tweets with app opens versus tweets without app opens. Include only tweets posted between 9 AM and 5 PM on weekdays andthis graph should work only between 12PM IST to 6PM IST and 7 AM to 11AM apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet impression should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet character count should be above 30 and need to remove tweet word which has letter 'D'.
I have completed all the tasks with all the requirements satisfied. Due to nature of tasks, output have came empty for task one and there is only one output for task 2. but due to concern I ask Null Training for guidance. as per they say, I didn't have to do think about output and do only task as given.
The Project was pretty Good hand on, I have learn a lot new about power BI, even though it was part of my degrre curriculam, going deep in the concept of DAX is very assuring for me. This project teacheas me not only how to do data analysis but it teaches me how complicated some requierments can be, and how difficult it is to meet them at a industry level.
Null CLass training is also worth while. they Teach the concept of DAX in thier video Lecture. as well as they have done some tasks live which helps in the hands on projects. like data/time relatade.
I am going to work in second project which is Play Store data Analysis using Python. I will be looking forword to see what I can Gain from this second Project.
